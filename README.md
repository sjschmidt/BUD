# BUD
This repository contains public versions of the BOSS Ultracool Dwarfs catalogs - right now, that's just one catalog, associated with the [First BOSS Ultracool Dwarfs Paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AJ....149..158S). 

[BUD Catalog v1.0](BUD_v1_0.fits): This is a catalog of 11,820 ultacool dwarfs identified as part of the initial SDSS BUD sample. The current version of the catalog includes data used to put together the first BUD paper: coordinates, SDSS IDs (spectroscopic plate, mjd, and fiber in addition to photometric run, rerun, etc.), spectral types, SDSS-2MASS-WISE photometry, Hα detections, and calculated χ values. Please look at the associated [README file](BUD_v1_0.README.txt) for definitions of each column, and see the [BUD I Paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1410.0014S) for additional discussion. Generally, measurements are included whether they were considered "good" or "bad," so please pay attention to the various flags included.

**Viewing Spectra**
To view a handful for spectra, I reccomend using the [SDSS finding chart service](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr10/en/tools/chart/image.aspx) (search by coordinates, then click explore) or try the [SDSS quicklook tool](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr12/en/tools/quicklook/) (search options are in the left menu bar). Both of those tools should have the option to download the spectrum you are looking at. For bulk downloads (probably worth it for tens to thousands of spectra), see [this site](https://www.sdss3.org/dr9/data_access/bulk.php) for instructions.
